# APIMisuseDeep

## JAVA 
In this folder, we present the implements of API sequence generation, which is shown as the .dot files and .png files.   
Examples can be found in this folder.  
If you want to use these code, please install the corresponding independencies first, which probably can spend you a lot of time.  
## PYTHON
In this floder, we presnet the data pre-processing and model parts.  
The data pre-processing part includes the **data_generation.py**, **Dot2Graph.py**,**filter_code.py**.  
The model part includes the **model.py**, **predict.py**.  
We also present the demo data ""sequence_data.txt"", which was generated by the original code.   
And the "train_data_demo.txt" and "train_label_demo.txt" is the demo data, which shows the formats of training data and testing data respectively.  
The vocab.txt is depend on your own generated API sequence data, and this file is also the demo.  
(Due to lack of maintain for a long period, the experiment data has been missed for some part. I have tried my best to illustrate the demo of those missing parts.)  
## DATA
This part only contains the link of MUBench, whose datasets were used in my experiment.    
The data could be rather large to download, so please pay attention to the space occupied by the download location.    
## NGRAM
This part of code is one of the baseline of my experience, please feel free to use it if necessary.
